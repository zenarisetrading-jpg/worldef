# Next Steps: Orchestrated 8-Page Redesign
## Executive Summary

---

## What You Approved

✓ Move to **Option B: Full Orchestration** (all 8 pages, parallel build)

With **strict guardrails:**
1. No giant fonts (max 48px for metrics)
2. Zero content fabrication (existing content only)
3. Minimal & suave aesthetic (no AI tells, no neon, no flash)

## What I'm Ready to Build

### Phase 0: Backup (Immediate)
- Save complete copy of current live site
- Work in separate `/redesign/` folder
- Zero risk to production

### Phase 1: Master Agent Foundation (6 hours)
Creates:
- ✓ Corrected design system (muted colors, reasonable fonts)
- ✓ Content extraction (every word from current HTML)
- ✓ 8 page briefs (layout instructions, no fabrication)
- ✓ Agent guardrails (strict rules)

### Phase 2: 8 Agents Build Simultaneously (12-16 hours)
- Agent 1: Homepage
- Agent 2: Features
- Agent 3: Agencies
- Agent 4: Compare
- Agent 5: About
- Agent 6: FAQ
- Agent 7: How It Works
- Agent 8: Audit Tool

Each agent:
- Uses ONLY extracted content
- Follows corrected design principles
- Validates against guardrails
- Produces clean, professional HTML

### Phase 3: Integration & Quality Check (4-6 hours)
- Combine all 8 pages
- Consistency audit
- Content verification (zero fabrication)
- Design validation (no AI tells)

### Phase 4: Your Review (2 hours)
- Preview integrated site
- Verify aesthetic
- Check content accuracy
- Approve or request adjustments

**Total Timeline: ~30 hours elapsed, 2-3 hours of your active time**

## Key Differences from Mockups

### What I Did Wrong in Mockups:
❌ Font sizes way too large (128px - eyesore)
❌ Fabricated content (34% retention, $12k upsell, etc.)
❌ AI design feel (neon, glow, Bloomberg terminal vibe)

### What Orchestration Will Do Right:
✅ Subtle font hierarchy (existing sizes, metrics 36-48px max)
✅ Exact content from current HTML (zero additions)
✅ Minimal & suave design (professional, clean, no flash)

## Guardrails Baked In

Every agent receives:

**Content Rules:**
- Use ONLY content from extraction JSON
- NO fabricated stats, testimonials, or social proof
- Every word must trace to original HTML

**Design Rules:**
- Max 48px font size (metrics only)
- Muted colors: Emerald-600, Slate-800, White
- NO neon, glow, heavy gradients, or flashy effects
- Simple hover states only (0.2s transitions)

**Layout Rules:**
- Subtle asymmetry (60/40 splits, not extreme)
- Reasonable spacing (80px sections)
- Simple grids (2-col, 3-col - no bento)
- NO sticky scroll, floating elements, or timeline connectors

**Validation Checklist:**
Before ANY work is submitted:
☐ All content from extraction?
☐ Font sizes < 48px?
☐ Colors muted/professional?
☐ NO AI design tells?
☐ Minimal and suave?

## What Gets Redesigned

### Visual/Layout Changes:
✓ Section organization (better flow)
✓ Asymmetric splits where appropriate
✓ Clean card layouts
✓ Professional color palette
✓ Subtle visual hierarchy
✓ Generous white space

### What Stays the Same:
✓ All content (word-for-word)
✓ All numbers/stats (exactly as-is)
✓ All links/CTAs (no changes)
✓ All functionality (no new features)
✓ Font sizes (existing base + slight metric bump)

## Examples: Corrected Approach

### Homepage Section 3 (Product Showcase)

**WRONG (Mockup):**
- Sticky video with floating metrics
- Dark gradient background
- Giant numbers (128px)
- Glow effects

**RIGHT (Orchestration):**
- Split layout: Video left (60%), Cards right (40%)
- White/light gray background
- Existing metric sizes (maybe 36px)
- Clean, simple presentation

### Agencies Section (Problem)

**WRONG (Mockup):**
- 3-Act structure with dramatic colors
- Fabricated dialogue
- Made-up ROI stats (34%, $12k, etc.)

**RIGHT (Orchestration):**
- 3 scenario cards (existing content only)
- Clean white cards
- Professional presentation
- ZERO fabricated numbers

If YES:
1. I create Master Agent foundation files
2. You review foundation (30 min)
3. We launch 8 agents

If NO / Need clarification:
- Tell me what needs adjustment
- I'll refine the plan
- We iterate until you're comfortable

**Your call. What do you think?**
