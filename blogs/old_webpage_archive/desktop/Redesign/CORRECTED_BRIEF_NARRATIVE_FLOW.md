# CORRECTED BRIEF: Data-Driven Narrative Flow (Proper Execution)

## What User Actually Wants

**FROM ORIGINAL MOCKUPS (Keep These Concepts):**
- ✓ Asymmetric layouts (60/40 splits, not centered everything)
- ✓ Zigzag patterns (alternating left/right content)
- ✓ Varied section backgrounds (white, light gray, dark - creates rhythm)
- ✓ Staggered/flowing arrangements (not rigid grids)
- ✓ Spatial relationships (elements positioned relative to each other)
- ✓ Non-linear flow (breaks section-section-section monotony)
- ✓ Visual hierarchy through layout (not just fonts)

**EXECUTION FIXES (From Feedback):**
- ✗ NO giant fonts (max 48px, use 36-42px for metrics)
- ✗ NO fabricated content (use existing only)
- ✗ NO neon/flashy (emerald-600 not 400, no glow effects)
- ✗ NO AI tells (professional, minimal, suave)

## CRITICAL: 1:1 Content Mapping Rule

**CONTENT MUST BE EXACTLY 1:1 FROM ORIGINAL HTML:**

This is NOT creative writing. This is EXACT content extraction and reflow.

✓ **Copy-paste exact text** from original HTML (no paraphrasing)
✓ **Match exact punctuation** (if original has "50+ clicks" use "50+ clicks" not "over 50 clicks")
✓ **Match exact capitalization** (if original says "Search Term Report" don't change to "search term report")
✓ **Match exact wording** (if original says "actually made money" don't change to "really made money")
✓ **Match exact numbers** ($2,847 not $2,800 or "approximately $2,800")
✓ **Match exact spacing/line breaks** in multi-line content

**Example - WRONG:**
Original: "Search terms with 50+ clicks and zero sales"
Agent writes: "Search terms that have more than 50 clicks but no sales"
❌ This is rewriting/paraphrasing - FORBIDDEN

**Example - RIGHT:**
Original: "Search terms with 50+ clicks and zero sales"
Agent writes: "Search terms with 50+ clicks and zero sales"
✓ Exact copy - CORRECT

**How to ensure 1:1 mapping:**
1. Open original HTML file
2. Find the exact text
3. Copy-paste it (don't retype, don't paraphrase)
4. Verify character-by-character match

**What changes:** Layout, positioning, styling, arrangement
**What doesn't change:** Any text content whatsoever

## Design Philosophy: Non-Linear Narrative

### What "Breaking Monotony" Actually Means:

**CURRENT SITE (Monotonous):**
```
Section 1: [Centered content, white bg]
Section 2: [Centered content, white bg]
Section 3: [Centered content, white bg]
Section 4: [Centered content, white bg]
Section 5: [Centered content, white bg]
```
**Problem:** Everything looks the same, predictable rhythm, boring scroll

**REDESIGNED (Non-Linear):**
```
Section 1: [Asymmetric 60/40, white bg]
Section 2: [Staggered cards, light gray bg]
Section 3: [Split left/right, white bg]
Section 4: [Zigzag layout, light gray bg]
Section 5: [Full-width, dark bg - accent]
Section 6: [Centered (intentional), white bg]
Section 7: [Asymmetric 55/45, dark bg]
```
**Solution:** Varied layouts, alternating backgrounds, intentional rhythm

---

## Specific Layout Transformations

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 1: Hero
**Current:** Centered headline, centered button
**Redesign:** Asymmetric 60/40 split

```
LEFT (60%):                           RIGHT (40%):
"See which Amazon ad                  [Floating card with metrics]
decisions actually made                 $2,847 burning/mo
money"                                  23 winners buried
                                        184 targets broken
Subtitle
Button                                [Clean white card, subtle shadow]
Proof text
```

**Why:** Breaks centered monotony, creates visual interest, same content

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 2: Problem Metrics
**Current:** 3 equal cards in a row
**Redesign:** Staggered diagonal flow

```
    [$2,847 burning/mo]
         ↘
            [23 winners buried]
                ↘
                    [184 targets broken]
```

**Visual:** Cards cascade down-right, slight offset, varied emphasis
**Why:** Creates flow/movement vs static row

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 3: Product Showcase
**Current:** Centered video, 4 cards below in grid
**Redesign:** Split layout with video emphasis

```
LEFT (55%):                           RIGHT (45%):
"This is what knowing                 [Card stack - tight spacing]
looks like"
                                      [Impact card]
[Video - larger]                      [ROAS card]
                                      [Score card]
Every number traces back...           [Trust card - dark accent]
```

**Why:** Video gets more space, cards create vertical rhythm on side

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 4: Process
**Current:** 3 steps with icons, horizontal
**Redesign:** Diagonal path with connecting flow

```
Step 1: Upload
    ↘ [connector line]
        Step 2: Review
            ↘ [connector line]
                Step 3: Results
```

**Visual:** Steps cascade diagonally, visual connectors show progression
**Why:** Suggests movement/journey vs static grid

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 5: Testimonial
**Current:** Centered quote block
**Redesign:** Dark background section (accent break)

```
[Dark slate-800 background - full width]

    "Clients always ask: what did we get for that $15k?"
    
    AdPulse gives agencies the answer —
    with proof clients actually understand.
    
    → See agency solutions
```

**Why:** Dark section creates visual break, rhythm change

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 6: Founder Story
**Current:** Centered text link
**Redesign:** Asymmetric with emphasis

```
LEFT (40%):                           RIGHT (60%):
[Empty - breathing room]              Built by a seller who spent
                                      $500k+ on PPC first.
                                      
                                      → Read the story
```

**Why:** Off-center creates unexpected pause, breathing room

---

### HOMEPAGE SECTION 7: Final CTA
**Current:** Centered CTA
**Redesign:** Split with urgency

```
LEFT (55%):                           RIGHT (45%):
Find out what your ad                 [Two buttons stacked]
decisions are actually worth.         
                                      [Primary: Run Impact Check]
Your data stays in your               [Secondary: Request Beta]
browser. Takes 2 minutes.
```

**Why:** Split creates balance, buttons grouped logically

---

## Background Rhythm Pattern

**CRITICAL:** Alternate backgrounds to break monotony

```
Section 1 (Hero):           White (#FFFFFF)
Section 2 (Problem):        Light gray (#F8FAFC)
Section 3 (Product):        White (#FFFFFF)
Section 4 (Process):        Light gray (#F8FAFC)
Section 5 (Testimonial):    Dark slate-800 (#1e293b) ← ACCENT
Section 6 (Founder):        White (#FFFFFF)
Section 7 (Final CTA):      Dark slate-900 (#0f172a) ← ACCENT
```

**Pattern:** Light → Light Gray → Light → Light Gray → Dark → Light → Dark

**Why:** Creates visual rhythm, dark sections act as "beats" that break monotony

---

## Typography Hierarchy (Corrected)

**Headlines:**
- H1 (Hero): 42-48px, Bold
- H2 (Section titles): 32-36px, Bold
- H3 (Card titles): 20-24px, Semibold

**Metrics:**
- Large emphasis: 36-42px, Bold (NOT 96px+)
- Medium emphasis: 28-32px, Bold
- Small emphasis: 20-24px, Semibold

**Body:**
- Primary: 16px, Regular
- Secondary: 14px, Regular
- Small: 12px, Regular

**KEY:** Hierarchy through SPACING and LAYOUT, not massive fonts

---

## Color Palette (Corrected)

**Primary:**
- Emerald-600: #059669 (NOT emerald-400 - too bright)
- Use for buttons, accents, links

**Neutrals:**
- Slate-900: #0f172a (text, dark sections)
- Slate-800: #1e293b (dark accent sections)
- Slate-600: #475569 (secondary text)
- Slate-50: #f8fafc (light backgrounds)
- White: #ffffff (primary backgrounds)

**Status (existing):**
- Success: #10B981 (green metrics)
- Danger: #EF4444 (red metrics like $2,847)
- Warning: #F59E0B (amber metrics)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Emerald-400, Cyan-400, or any "neon" variants
- Heavy gradients (subtle gradients OK)
- Glow effects, pulsing animations

---

## Spacing & Rhythm

**Section Padding:**
- Standard: 80px vertical
- Compact: 60px vertical (for tighter sections)
- Spacious: 100px vertical (for breathing room)

**Vary the padding** to create rhythm:
```
Hero: 100px (spacious)
Problem: 80px (standard)
Product: 100px (spacious)
Process: 80px (standard)
Testimonial: 60px (compact, dark bg)
Founder: 80px (standard)
CTA: 80px (standard)
```

**Card Spacing:**
- Tight: 16px gaps (stacked cards)
- Standard: 24px gaps (normal grids)
- Loose: 32px gaps (feature cards)

---

## Layout Principles (Non-Linear)

### 1. Asymmetric Splits
```
60/40 - Hero, Product showcase
55/45 - Final CTA, Founder
50/50 - Only when intentional balance needed
```

**NOT:** Everything 50/50 centered

### 2. Zigzag Pattern
```
Section A: Content left, image right
Section B: Image left, content right
Section C: Content left, image right
```

**Creates:** Visual flow, eye movement

### 3. Staggered Elements
```
Instead of:          Use:
[Card] [Card]        [Card]
[Card] [Card]           [Card]
                           [Card]
```

**Creates:** Diagonal flow, movement

### 4. Dark Section Accents
```
Use 1-2 dark sections max
Place strategically to "break" the page
Dark = visual anchor, creates pause
```

### 5. Intentional Centering
```
Use centering sparingly for emphasis
When everything is asymmetric, centered = special
Example: Testimonial quote (centered on dark bg)
```

## Animation & Interaction (Minimal)

**ALLOWED:**
- Hover transitions: 0.2s ease
- Button lift on hover: translateY(-2px)
- Link underlines on hover
- Fade-in on scroll (optional, subtle)

**FORBIDDEN:**
- Sticky scroll sections
- Progressive reveals
- Floating elements that appear
- Count-up animations
- Pulsing/glowing effects
- Complex scroll-triggered animations

---

## Component Styling (Minimal & Clean)

**Buttons:**
```css
background: #059669 (emerald-600)
padding: 12px 24px
border-radius: 8px
font-weight: 600
box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)

hover:
  transform: translateY(-2px)
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
```

**Cards:**
```css
background: white
border: 1px solid #e2e8f0
border-radius: 12px
padding: 32px
box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)

hover:
  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
```

**Dark Cards (Accent):**
```css
background: #1e293b (slate-800)
color: white
border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)
```

## Visual Reference Examples

**GOOD (What to aim for):**
- Linear.app - Asymmetric layouts, clean, varied rhythm
- Stripe.com - Alternating sections, intentional white space
- Pitch.com - Diagonal flows, staggered elements
- Cal.com - Split layouts, dark accent sections

**BAD (What to avoid):**
- My original mockups (too flashy, giant fonts)
- Current agent output (just color swap, no layout change)
- Generic templates (everything centered, no rhythm)
- AI-generated sites (neon, over-designed)

## Validation Checklist (Before Approval)

**Content:**
☐ Every word from original HTML?
☐ Every number from original HTML?
☐ Every link/CTA from original HTML?
☐ ZERO fabricated content?

**Layout (THIS IS THE REDESIGN):**
☐ Asymmetric layouts used (not everything centered)?
☐ Background rhythm (white/gray/dark alternation)?
☐ Varied section compositions (not all same)?
☐ Staggered/flowing elements (not rigid grids)?
☐ Dark sections used as accents (1-2 max)?

**Typography:**
☐ Max font size 48px?
☐ Metrics 36-42px (not 96px+)?
☐ Hierarchy through spacing, not just size?

**Aesthetic:**
☐ Emerald-600 (not emerald-400)?
☐ No neon, glow, or flashy effects?
☐ Professional and minimal?
☐ Looks human-designed (no AI tells)?

**Feel:**
☐ Does it LOOK different from current site?

## Key Difference from Agent's Output

**Agent Did (WRONG):**
- Just swapped colors
- Kept exact same layouts
- Everything still centered
- All sections look identical
- Predictable rhythm
- **Result:** Boring, just a color swap

**Agent Should Do (RIGHT):**
- Keep exact same CONTENT
- Change ALL layouts (asymmetric, zigzag, staggered)
- Alternate backgrounds (white/gray/dark rhythm)
- Vary section compositions
- Create non-linear flow
- **Result:** Same content, completely different feel

---

## Example: Hero Section Comparison

**Current Site (Agent's Output):**
```html
<section style="text-align: center; padding: 80px 0; background: white;">
  <h1>Headline</h1>
  <p>Subtitle</p>
  <button>CTA</button>
  <p>Proof text</p>
</section>
```

**Redesigned (What We Want):**
```html
<section style="padding: 100px 0; background: white;">
  <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 60% 40%; gap: 60px; align-items: center;">
    
    <!-- LEFT: Content -->
    <div>
      <h1 style="font-size: 48px; line-height: 1.1; margin-bottom: 24px;">
        Headline
      </h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #475569; margin-bottom: 32px;">
        Subtitle
      </p>
      <button style="...">CTA</button>
      <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #64748b; margin-top: 16px;">
        Proof text
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- RIGHT: Floating metric card -->
    <div style="background: white; border: 1px solid #e2e8f0; border-radius: 16px; padding: 32px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);">
      <div style="font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; color: #ef4444; margin-bottom: 8px;">
        $2,847
      </div>
      <div style="font-size: 14px; color: #64748b;">
        burning every month
      </div>
      <hr style="margin: 24px 0; border-color: #e2e8f0;">
      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 16px; text-align: center;">
        <div>
          <div style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #059669;">23</div>
          <div style="font-size: 12px; color: #64748b;">winners buried</div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #f59e0b;">184</div>
          <div style="font-size: 12px; color: #64748b;">targets broken</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
  </div>
</section>
```

**See the difference?**
- Same content
- COMPLETELY different layout
- Asymmetric 60/40 split
- Floating card on right
- Reasonable font sizes (48px, 36px, 24px)
- Clean, minimal, professional

This is the brief for what the redesign should actually be.
